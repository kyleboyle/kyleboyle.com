      <description>I decided I would like to try a mechanical keyboard but an off the shelf option just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do. Here were my requirements:
 small form factor (tenkeyless, no numpad) function key row OSX compatible (media keys, other shortcuts)  There are a variety of options and feature levels out there but I chose to go with one of the most basic options: a Filco Majestouch 2. The most important aspect about this model is that there is a replacement controller available with which I can use firmware that enables custom key maps and functions.</description>
