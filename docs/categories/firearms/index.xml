      <description>The Glock 17 comes from the factory with about a 5 pound trigger pull. This isn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but it&amp;rsquo;s also not great depending on your intended use. I only use my G17 for target practice and maybe competition in the future so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any legality issues with gun modifications and self defense. A lighter and smoother trigger pull will hopefully help increase my accuracy by reducing the force needed to squeeze the trigger, increasing the likelihood of staying on target.</description>
